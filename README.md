College Basketball - Offence vs Defense

By: Cody Kane and Desmond Ramirez

Our goal is to decide whether offence or defence is more influential in a team's success in college basketball.
We chose this because we both enjoy watching college basketball. This was not our initial idea, but we struggled with finding the right data for the first idea, so we switched to comparing offence or defence, as we both talked about it and had different thoughts. 

Our research questions will be:

Question 1: Which has more influence, scoring more or getting scored on less, for a team trying to win the NCAA championship? 

Question 2: Will this change if we look at winning games against the top teams, or just winning games in general? 

Question 3: Since the game is constantly evolving and this year had some first in a long time events in the NCAA tournament, will our findings stand for this year ?
